Sept 6 2014. 

Started the project. 
At this point I just moved the webgl_custom_attributes_particles2.html example into this browserify/watchify setup. install watchify globally then just run this command to get everything going. 

watchify src/index.js -o build/index.js -v


Something is wrong with the node import and the first line needs to be commented out otherwise it looks like everything is twice as big (retina issue?).

//var self = self || {};// File:src/Three.js

The sprite image was also base 64 encoded into a string just so that chrome would not whine while running it locally.
